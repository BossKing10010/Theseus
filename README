OpenData
========
OpenData is an open-source personal tracking tool that uses your iPhone 5S's location and motion sensors to help you track and visualize where you spend your time. It's very similar to [Moves](http://moves-app.com) or [Google Latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Latitude).

One of the key differences between OpenData and other similar apps is its approach to privacy and data accessibility. By default, your data never leaves your phone; all processing happens on-device rather than an external server. If you want to access your data for personal usage, OpenData can export your data to Dropbox in JSON format for easy access.


Installation
------------
Although OpenData will eventually be available on the iOS App Store, you must currently compile it from source.

It currently requires an iPhone 5S, as it makes use of the M7 motion coprocessor.

Assuming you want to run OpenData on your physical iPhone, you will need to be a member of Apple's [iOS Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action).

1. Clone this git repo

`git clone git@github.com:lazerwalker/OpenData.git`

2. Copy `Configuration.plist.example` to `Configuration.plist`.

3. Create a new Foursquare app (https://foursquare.com/developers/register), and a new Dropbox app (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps). These will be necessary to fetch Foursquare venues and export your data to Dropbox.

4. Open up `OpenData.xcworkspace` in Xcode. Open `Configuration.plist`, and enter the credentials for the Dropbox and Foursquare apps you created in the previous step.

5. Build and run the app. It should just work!


Running Tests from the Command Line
-----------------------------------
You can run OpenData's test suite from the command line by running the `rake test` command from inside the root project directory.
